Declarative knowledge: facts
Imperative knowledge: instuctions on how to do things
    Algorithm: step-by-step instuctions; "a finite list of instuctions describing a set of computations that when executed on a set of inputs will proceed through a sequence of well-defined states and eventually produce an output." (p.g 3)
        Finite: has a set amount of instuctions. It is not endless or unknown.
Computer programing: creating algorithms
